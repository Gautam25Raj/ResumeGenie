We welcome and encourage contributions through pull requests. If you have a code fix, improvement, or new feature to propose, follow these steps:

<h3 id='fork-the-repository'> 1. Fork the Repository:</h3>

Start by forking the Resume Genie repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account.

<h3 id='set-up-your-local-environment'> 2. Set Up Your Local Environment:</h3>

Clone the forked repository to your local machine and follow the installation instructions provided in the project's [Developer's Guide](DEVELOPER.md). This will set up the necessary dependencies and get you ready to work on the project.

- **Clone** the forked repo
- Install the dependencies
- Run the project
  
<h3 id='create-a-new-branch'> 3. Create a New Branch:</h3>

Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the nature of your work.

```
# Create a new branch
$ git branch <branch-name>

# Switch to the newly created branch
$ git checkout <branch-name>
```

**Note: Replace <branch-name> with a descriptive name for your branch.**

After running these commands, you will have created a new branch with a name of your choice and switched to that branch. You can then make your changes and commit them to this branch.

<h3 id='make-changes'> 4. Make Changes:</h3>

Implement your changes or additions in the appropriate files within the project. Ensure that your code follows the existing coding style and conventions [Developer's Guide](DEVELOPER.md).

<h3 id='test-your-changes'> 5. Test Your Changes:</h3>
Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as intended and do not introduce any new issues.

<h3 id='commit-and-push'> 6. Commit and Push:</h3>

Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. Push the changes to your forked repository.

```
# Add the changes to the staging area
$ git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push the changes to the remote repository
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```

After running these commands, your changes will be committed with the specified message and pushed to the remote repository in the specified branch.

Your pull request will undergo review by the project maintainers. Be responsive to feedback and address any requested changes promptly. Discuss and collaborate with the maintainers to ensure the quality and coherence of your contribution.

**Note: After a pull request has been open for over 30 days with no activity or response from the author, it'll be automatically marked as stale. We might fork your changes and merge the changes ourselves. Since GitHub tracks contributions by commits, you will be credited.**
