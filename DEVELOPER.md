## üë®‚Äçüíª Coding Style and Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability across the codebase, we follow the following coding style and guidelines for Resume Genie:

### General Guidelines

- Use meaningful and descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- Keep lines of code reasonably short (preferably less than 80 characters) to enhance readability.
- Comment your code when necessary to provide clarity and context.
- Use Prettier for better and easy Formatting

### Indentation and Formatting

- Use spaces for indentation with a consistent indentation level of 2 spaces.
- Use spaces around operators for better readability.
- Use consistent and clear formatting throughout the codebase.

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class and component names.
- Use single quotes ('') for string literals unless interpolation is required.
- Prefer arrow functions (`() => {}`) over traditional function expressions.
- Use template literals (\`\`) for concatenating strings when necessary.
- Prefer `const` for declaring variables unless the value needs to be reassigned.
- Use destructuring where appropriate to simplify code.
- Avoid unnecessary or redundant code and imports.
- Follow best practices and conventions for React components, Redux state management, and other libraries used in the project.

### Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components and layouts.
- Follow the utility-first approach and utilize Tailwind CSS classes directly in your JSX.
- Avoid writing custom CSS whenever possible to leverage the built-in Tailwind CSS utilities.
- Organize your styles by using the `className` prop or by applying multiple utility classes to an element.
- Reuse existing Tailwind CSS classes instead of creating new ones whenever possible.
- Follow the responsive design principles provided by Tailwind CSS for handling different screen sizes.

### JSX/CSS

- Use proper indentation and formatting for JSX markup.
- Use lowercase for JSX tags and attributes.
- Use double quotes ("") for attribute values.
- Prefer CSS classes for styling over inline styles.
- Follow a consistent and scalable CSS architecture (e.g., BEM, SMACSS, or your preferred methodology).

### üß¢ Basic Git Commands Guidelines

  ```
  $ git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME

  - Please provide a git message that explains what you've done
  - Commit to the forked repository
    ```
    $ git commit -am 'Add some proper message'
    ```

- **Push** to the branch

  ```
  $ git push origin BRANCH_NAME
  ```
