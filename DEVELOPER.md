<h2 id='project-overview'>üì¶ Project Overview</h2>

Resume Genie is a free and open-source resume builder software that aims to make the process of creating, updating, and sharing resumes easy and efficient. It leverages technologies like React, Node.js, Tesseract.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS to provide a user-friendly and feature-rich experience for users.

<br>

<h2 id='architecture'>üî® Architecture</h2>

Resume Genie follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is built using React and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. The backend is developed with Node.js and Express.js, which handles API requests and interacts with the MongoDB database. Tesseract.js is integrated to extract information from resume images.

For more detailed Architecture to the project, refer to the [Architecture Guide](Architecture.md) document.

<h2 id='prerequisites'>üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Prerequisites</h2>

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 14.x)
- Npm or Yarn package manager
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or a remote instance)

  - Back-End

    ```
    $ cd backend
    $ npm install
    ```

- Setup **Environment Variable**:

  - Create a .env file in both folder front-end and back-end of the project and set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the [Environment Variable](ENVIRONMENT.md) for the required environment variables.

- Start the development server & Run the following command to run the project in your local computer.

  - Front-End

    ```
    $ cd client
    $ npm start
    ```

  - Back-End

    ```
    $ cd backend
    $ npm start
