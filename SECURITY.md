# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Resume Genie, we take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any potential issues you may discover. We encourage you to report any vulnerabilities you find in our repository by following the guidelines below:

1. **Submit a Report:** Please send an email to our security team at [security@resumegenie.com](mailto:gautamraj255225@gmail.com) to report the vulnerability. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant information that can help us understand and address the issue.

2. **Responsibility:** We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue. We aim to respond to vulnerability reports promptly and keep you informed of our progress throughout the resolution process.

3. **Cooperation:** We appreciate your cooperation and willingness to work with our team to resolve the vulnerability. We may request additional information or clarifications from you, and we encourage open communication to ensure a smooth and efficient resolution.

4. **Acknowledgment:** Once the vulnerability has been confirmed and resolved, we are happy to acknowledge your contribution to the security of our repository. We will provide appropriate credit and recognition to individuals or organizations who responsibly report vulnerabilities to us.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all versions and branches of the repository. It covers security vulnerabilities in the codebase, configuration files, and associated project components.

## Patching Vulnerabilities
If a vulnerability is found to be valid, it will be patched as soon as possible. The patch will be released in a new version of the Resume Genie repository.

## Communication
The Resume Genie team will communicate with you throughout the vulnerability reporting and patching process. You will be kept informed of the status of the investigation and the patch release.

## Expectations

- Our team will make every effort to acknowledge vulnerability reports within few business days and provide regular updates on the progress of the resolution.
- We request that reporters of vulnerabilities comply with responsible disclosure practices and maintain the confidentiality of any information related to the vulnerability until it is resolved.
- We encourage all contributors and users of the repository to keep their dependencies up to date and follow best practices for secure coding, such as input validation and secure data storage.

## Acknowledgement
We appreciate your help in keeping the Resume Genie repository secure. If you report a vulnerability that is found to be valid, you will be acknowledged in the patch release notes.

## Disclaimer

While we strive to maintain a secure repository, it is important to note that no software is entirely free from vulnerabilities. We appreciate your understanding and collaboration in helping us identify and mitigate any security risks that may arise.

This security policy is subject to change without prior notice, and we encourage you to review it periodically for any updates or amendments.

Thank you for your assistance in keeping our repository secure!
